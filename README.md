<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The improvement of radiotherapy depends largely on the implementation of innovations, of which effectivity varies widely. The aim of this study is to develop a prediction model for successful innovation implementation in radiotherapy to improve effective management of innovation projects.<br>
A multivariate prediction model was built to predcit the chance an an innovation being timely implemented. The prediction model contains the following determinants: (1) sufficient and competent employees, (2) complexity, (3) understanding/ awareness of the project goals and process by employees, (4) feasibility and desirability. The area Under the curve (AUC) of the internal validation of the model was 0.86 (0.8–0.92, 95% CI). External validation was done on a completely new dataset. Comparing the outcome predictions with the observed outcomes of all innovations resulted in an AUC of the external validation of the prediction model of 0.72 (0.60 – 0.84, 95% CI). <br>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

*Step 1*: Classify innovation as: 
<p>- treatment innovation (treatments that are new, or which constitute a significant improvement in terms of their characteristics or intended use); 
<p>- technological innovation (new or significantly improved treatment process or delivery method that has no noticeable consequences for the treatment; including significant changes in the techniques applied, the equipment used or the available software of the devices); 
<p>- organizational innovation (new or significant changes in clinic organizational structure or management methods/systems).

*Step 2*: Answer the following questions (by project leader and all project members):<br>
<p>- Is the project an organisational innovation? Yes/No<br>
<p>- Is the project a treatment innovation? Yes/No<br>
<p>- Sufficient and competent employees to perform this project? Yes/No<br>
<p>- Is it a complex (integration of many functionalities and devices / many professionals) project? Yes/No<br>
<p>- Good understanding and awareness of the project goals and process? Yes/No<br>
<p>- Good feasibility & desirability? Yes/No<br>

*Step 3*: Use logistic regression formula to calculate the chance of timely implementation.<br>
